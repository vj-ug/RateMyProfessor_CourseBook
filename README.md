# RateMyProfessor_UniversityCourseBook

A chrome extension which lets you see Professor ratings from RateMyProfessor on your unviversity's coursebook

  -  Do you check Professor rating's while choosing a class? (Even though I feel every professor is great in his/her own way) 
  -  This extension makes the process simple for you. Display the ratings next to your coursebook
  
  - ~~Currently it only supports my university,~~ however I plan to collaborate with my friends at different universities to create a big list of supported universities.
  - 
  - Update Works with ANY university. You do need to change the link of your college in the source code.   I am currently working on to make a GUI for the same.
